# Introduction
The men's FIFA World Ranking is a ranking system for men's national teams in association football, currently led by Belgium.[1] The teams of the men's member nations of FIFA, football's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. The rankings were introduced in December 1992, and eight teams (Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) have held the top position, of which Brazil have spent the longest ranked first.

A points system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of all FIFA-recognised full international matches. The ranking system has been revamped on several occasions, generally responding to criticism that the preceding calculation method did not effectively reflect the relative strengths of the national teams. Since 16 August 2018, the current version of the ranking system has adopted the Elo rating system used in chess and Go.

## Specyfying the Data Analytic Question 
The main aim of our research is to find an appropriate model that will predict whether a home team will loose or win

## Defining the Metric for Success

In order to perform a successful analysis we first need to perform univariate analysis which will help us understand more about the important variables individually. This way, when we perform other analysis, we will be able to understand better. We we also be doing bivariate analysis.

We will finally conclude with building models that can help us make predictions.
